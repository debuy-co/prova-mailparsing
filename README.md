Weâ€™re creating a web app with two main parts:

    1.	Client-side (React): A user-friendly interface that fetches and displays emails.
    2.	Server-side (Node.js): Handles the connection to an email account (using IMAP), fetches emails, and parses them.

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is used by email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server. For example, Apple Mail and Gmail use IMAP. Using the imap package, we will connect to the email server and retrieve unread emails and attachments.

Overview of the Steps

    1.	Set up the React frontend.
    2.	Create a Node.js server.
    3.	Install and configure the imap package for accessing emails.
    4.	Parse the email content using mailparser.
    5.	Connect React to Node.js using HTTP requests.
